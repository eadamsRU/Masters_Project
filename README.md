## <span style="color:#FFA07A;">Hypothesis</span>
H0 (Null Hypothesis): 

* There is no significant correlation between climate change factors (temperature, sea levels) and the quantity/quality of salmon caught in Alaska.

H1 (Alternative Hypothesis):

* Rising ocean temperatures and sea levels significantly impacting the quantity and quality of Alaskan salmon, leading to noticeable effects on the fishing industry.

## <span style="color:#FFA07A;">Why this is important</span>
* Largest harvest in North America: Alaska's salmon harvest is the largest in North America, accounting for about 80% of the total wild-caught catch. 
* Employment: More Alaskans work in salmon harvesting and processing than in any other commercial fishery. 
* Economics: Salmon accounts for the majority of the value of Alaska seafood.

## <span style="color:#1ff2cf;">Challenges facing the salmon industry</span>
* Inflation: High inflation and interest rates have squeezed profits and liquidity for salmon processors. 
* Labor: Wages for processing workers have increased sharply. 
* Fuel: Diesel fuel prices have increased sharply. 
* Competition: Alaskan fishermen compete against unsustainable fishing and forced labor in foreign imports.

## <span style="color:#FFA07A;">Key Factors</span>
Environmental Data:

* Ocean and river temperatures over time.
* Sea level changes in Alaskan fishing regions.
* Ocean pH levels (impacting food chains).
* Climate patterns (precipitation, storms, etc.).

Salmon Population & Quality Data:

* Total catch size (commercial and subsistence fishing).
* Average salmon weight and size.
* Disease prevalence and mortality rates.
* Changes in migration and spawning behaviors.

Economic & Industry Impact:

* Revenue trends in the Alaskan salmon industry.
* Changes in regulations and fishing quotas.
* Shifts in fishing seasons due to climate change.
